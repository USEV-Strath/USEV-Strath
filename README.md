## About us

We are an entirely student-led team that designs, builds and tests a battery-electric prototype vehicle to compete in the [European Shell Eco-Marathon](https://www.makethefuture.shell/en-gb/shell-eco-marathon).

By joining the team you can be involved in everything from designing and manufacturing the car to team management, marketing and sponsorship. You will have the opportunity to meet and work with engineering students from a range of disciplines or our marketing team which is led by students from the business school. We have subteams covering a range of skills and areas such as mechanical design, carbon fibre, aerodynamics, electrical and PCB design, battery construction/design, programming and marketing.
